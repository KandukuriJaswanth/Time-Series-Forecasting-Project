🚀 Thrilled to Share My Time Series Forecasting Project!
During my internship at MindShift Technologies, I worked on a Time Series Forecasting project using Python to analyze and predict data trends. It’s been an amazing experience to sharpen my skills in data science and machine learning!
Project Highlights: 🔍 Data Analysis:
Utilized pandas for data manipulation.
Created insightful visualizations with seaborn and matplotlib.
Generated detailed data insights using ydata_profiling.
📈 Time Series Modeling:
Built a forecasting model using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
💡 Key Achievements:
Gained valuable insights into seasonal and trend patterns.
Strengthened my ability to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to tackle real-world problems.
Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels
Machine Learning: ARIMA Model
